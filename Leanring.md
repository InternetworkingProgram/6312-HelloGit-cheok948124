###Learning outcome
So far, I have learnt how git works and what are the functions come with it. Commands such as:
```
git branch
git add
git commit
git clone
```
I am not quite sure about the push and pull. Does pull mean I am requesting to push or I am
pulling data from the repo? In the document, it said that I can create a pull request and add commits
to it and push if permit. But in the ppt, it also said that it is the way to get the data from remote
server to the local machine. I am confused.
